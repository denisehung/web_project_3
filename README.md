# Web Project 3 - From Portland to Portland

## Project description

This is the third Web Project for the Practicum Web Development bootcamp. By using media queries I created the responsive web page 'From Portland to Portland' about traveling across the US. The page is based on a design created in Figma and created with only HTML and CSS (Flexbox and Grid). The BEM methodology has been applied to structure both CSS and project files.

The project can be viewed here [https://denisehung.github.io/web_project_3/](https://denisehung.github.io/web_project_3/)
